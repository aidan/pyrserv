Install R
===========
Requires:
- X11 devel package (suse), png-devel, jpeg-devel (otherwise it cannot write png/jpeg files!)

Compilation:
1. Unpack R-2.13.1.tar.gz
2. In directory R-2.13.1
   $ ./configure --enable-R-shlib
   $ make
   $ make install
   
   
Install Rserve:
===============
1. Download package e.g. into /usr/local/src
2. cd /usr/local/src
   No need to untar it for compiling Rserve, only if the client should be compiled
3. R CMD INSTALL Rserve_0.6-6.tar.gz

This way also the debug version will be compiled and installed.

To start Rserver type:

    $ R CMD Rserve

To start Rserve in debug mode type:

    $ R CMD Rserve.dbg

Now it is ready to be connected from a client.
